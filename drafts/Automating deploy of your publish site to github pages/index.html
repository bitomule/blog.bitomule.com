Although we donâ€™t have that support we can publish just using the github deploy method.</p><h2>Creating the repo</h2><p>In order to deploy your blog in Github Pages you have to create a new repository where only the published blog will live. This means that if you already have a repo with your site source code you will have to create a new one to host the static files.</p><p>Just create an empty Github repository and youâ€™re safe to go.</p><h2>Deploy</h2><p>On the previous post we created our own theme but we didnâ€™t focus much in the publish method. It may look like this right now:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">try</span> <span class="type">Blog</span>().<span class="call">publish</span>(
    withTheme: .<span class="dotAccess">blog</span>
)
</code></pre><p>Just enough to generate your blog that you can manually upload to whatever hosting you choose. If you want publish to deploy the blog for you you need to add the deployUsing argument. In our case we wanâ€™t to deploy to using github so it will look like:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">try</span> <span class="type">Blog</span>().<span class="call">publish</span>(
    withTheme: .<span class="dotAccess">blog</span>,
    deployedUsing: .<span class="call">gitHub</span>(<span class="string">"yourusername/yourrepo"</span>),
)
</code></pre><p>Use the repo you just created as the target repository and now you can just run:</p><pre><code>publish deploy
</code></pre><p>And Publish will deploy the generated files to your empty repo. You can use this command each time you want to deploy your blog.</p><h2>Enabling github pages</h2><p>In order to activate your site you have to enable Github Pages for the repository with your static files. To do that just go to your repository settings, scroll down to GitHub Pages and configure it. You can use a custom domain if you want to and choose master as the source (ThatÂ´s why you have a repo just with blog content).</p><p>This will create a CNAME file in your repository telling GitHub the domains it can handle. Also keep in mind youâ€™ll have to change your domain DNS CNAME registry to your Github page url.</p><p>If you want to use https with a custom domain youâ€™ll have to use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> (A free CDN service) that will also improve your site speed. Please <a href="https://twitter.com/bitomule">let me know</a> if you are interested in a blog post about the Cloudflare setup.</p><h2>Automating</h2><p>Right now you should have your website running, available to the public and deployed using a one line command.</p><p>This is good enough for most people but we can go one step further and make it automatic so a new website version will be deployed each time we commit changes to our blog repository.</p><p>We can do this for free using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Actions</a>. Weâ€™ll create a new Github Action workflow in the repo that hosts our blog source that will:</p><ul><li>Launch a macOS virtual machine</li><li>Checkout our repo</li><li>Generate static files</li><li>Publish to your Github Pages repository</li><li>Commit changes to source repo (You can skip this one and ignore output folder in your source repo)</li></ul><p>In order to create your first Github Action go to the Actions tab in your source repo and tap New Workflow. You can choose the getting started Workflow and delete all the content.</p><p>Here you have the YAML file I use in my own repo:</p><pre><code>name: <span class="type">Publish</span>

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macOS-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  
    - name: <span class="type">Generate</span> blog
      run: swift run <span class="type">Blog</span>
    - name: <span class="type">Publish</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> github pages repo
      uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages@v1.<span class="number">4.0</span>
      with:
        repo: youruser/yourrepository
        target_branch: master
        keep_history: <span class="keyword">true</span>
        allow_empty_commit: <span class="keyword">false</span>
        build_dir: <span class="type">Output</span>
        committer_name: yourname 
        commit_message: <span class="type">Update</span> blog content
      env:
        <span class="type">GITHUB_PAT</span>: ${{ secrets.<span class="type">REPO_TOKEN</span> }}
        
    - name: <span class="type">Add</span> &amp; <span class="type">Commit</span> changes
      uses: <span class="type">EndBug</span>/add-and-commit@v4.<span class="number">0.1</span>
      with:
        author_name: yourname
        message: <span class="type">Commit</span> new output
</code></pre><p>The last step to get this working is <a href="https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.17/user/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line">creating a Github token</a> with access to your Github Page repository and adding it inside your source repository Secrets as REPO_TOKEN. (You can find secrets inside your repository settings).</p><p>Now each time you commit to the master branch of your source repository Github will publish the content for you. Isnâ€™t it awesome?</p><h2>Drafts</h2><p>Automation feels like magic as you no longer have to go through Publish but it also means that each time you commit your blogpost itâ€™ll get published and all your readers can see it. To avoid that I created a drafts folder next to my blogposts. Itâ€™s still possible to read them if people gets into the repository but they are not available in the published website.</p><p>You can also use branches and even create pull requests if that makes sense to you.</p><h2>iPad blogging</h2><p>Iâ€™m not going to lie, I added all this automation because I wanted to write my blogposts using my iPad and running publish deploy from the iPad is just not possible (as today ðŸ˜›).</p><p>My setup is quite easy but works really well:</p><ul><li>I use <strong>Working copy</strong> to manage the repository. Itâ€™s not a cheap application but it does an amazing job if you want to have a git repository on your iOS device. The best feature of Working copy is that it shares you repository as a resource inside Files app and that means you can open and edit files from your repo inside other apps.</li><li>That other app, in my case, is <strong>iA Writer</strong>. Iâ€™ve been trying multiple markdown editing applications but the support iA Writer has to open folders from Files sources is just what I need. I just have 2 folder references inside iA Writer: posts and drafts.</li><li>Iâ€™ve a custom shortcut to create metadata for each blog</li></ul><p>So the process when I want to start a new blog post is just: 1. Run a shortcut from my iPad home screen 2. Type tile and tags (I want to improve this step using Data Jar to have some already defined tags) 3. The shortcut opens iA Writer for me so I just have to create a new draft, paste metadata and start Writing.</p><p>Once the draft is ready to be published I just move it to the posts folder, push my repository to remote and Github Actions takes care of publishing it.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed reading this and it helps you improve your blogging flow so you can share more interesting content with all your readers. Please let me know if you want to know more about something or thereâ€™s something you missed ðŸ™‚.</p></div></div></div><div class="footer pure-u-1"><div class="pure-u-1">Â© 2020 Bitomule's learning shack</div><div class="pure-u-1">Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>.
